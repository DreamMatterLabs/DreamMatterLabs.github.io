<h2 class="post-heading">Hello World!</h2>

We're a brand-new indie game studio called Dream Matter Labs. 

As a group of juniors, we know firsthand how exhausting it is to break into the game industry nowadays. What was once a welcoming place filled with experimentation and unconventionality, has now shut its doors and become a place depraved of these very same qualities.

In 2024 alone, 14.600 people were reportedly laid off in the game industry as various companies prioritized their short-term metrics and downsized their teams. As a result, the job market is now bursting at the seams with more and more people eager for an opportunity, all competing for the same job openings.

Especially for juniors, breaking into the game industry has therefore become a battle that is nearly impossible to win. As a result, we have come to the conclusion that the beaten path fos us is one with a dead endâ€”encouraging us to create our own studio!

At Dream Matter Labs, we dedicate ourselves to bringing dreams to life and reigniting the qualities that the industry has long lost. Specifically, we focus on creating surreal, narrative-driven experiences that immerse, inspire, and challenge conventions.
