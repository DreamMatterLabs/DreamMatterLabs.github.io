<h2 class="post-heading">Hello World!</h2>

We're a brand-new indie game studio called Dream Matter Labs. 

**21 March, 2025â€”**As a group of juniors, we know firsthand how exhausting it is to break into the game industry nowadays. What was once a welcoming place filled with experimentation and unconventionality, has now shut its doors to those trying to get in and become a place depraved of these very same qualities.

In 2024 alone, 14.600 people were reportedly laid off in the game industry as various companies prioritized their short-term metrics and downsized their teams. As a result, the job market is now bursting at the seams with more and more people eager for an opportunity, all competing for the same limited job openings.

Therefore, especially for juniors, breaking into the game industry has become a battle that is nearly impossible to win. Because of all this, we have realized that the beaten path fos us is one with a dead end and that we need to find a way to forge our own. As a result, we assembled a team of 15 junior volunteers and founded our own indie studio!

Here, at Dream Matter Labs, we dedicate ourselves to bringing dreams to life and reigniting the qualities that the industry has long lost. Specifically, we focus on creating surreal, narrative-driven experiences that immerse, inspire, and challenge conventions.
