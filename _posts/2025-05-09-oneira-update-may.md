<h2 class="post-h2">Hey There!</h2>

A lot has happened since <a class="post-link" href="https://dreammatterlabs.com/">ONEiRA</a> got revealed to the world so I felt that itâ€™s about time I gave you an update on what weâ€™ve been working on. Naturally, I'll make sure to include some (highly classified) images to properly show you what is new!

<h2 class="post-h2">Polishing and Touching Up</h2>

Mainly, now that we have a <a class="post-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3521080/ONEiRA/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=other&utm_campaign=wishlist&utm_content=blogpost_5" target="_blank">Steam page</a> up and running, the focus has been on making a trailer and ensuring that the necessary features and areas are polished. SO, as a result, a lot of areas have gotten a proper lighting pass and a brand new look. ðŸ˜Ž

In my eyes, environmental lighting is such an underestimated part of game development as it seems like a small cog in the machine but really makes a world of difference. If done right, it makes a game come to life and helps guide the player. âœ¨

<h2 class="post-h2">Laying the UI Groundwork</h2>

You may or may not have noticed that UI has been missing from all our images so far. BUT, trust and believe that it is being worked on. Similarly to environmental lighting, I find UI to be such a crucial part of game development so it's super-duper exciting!

Do keep in mind that this is an early draft of the UI and will be updated significantly in the upcoming weeksâ€”So stay tuned! For now, this is a prototype of a menu that allows players to access their inventory, view their progress, and learn about <a class="post-link" href="https://dreammatterlabs.com/">ONEiRA</a>.

<h2 class="post-h2">A Glimpse Into the Future</h2>

Although, while Iâ€™ve mainly shown you stuff about our trippy mushroom world, a new one is right around the corner! In terms of technology, this techno dreamscape will definitely be our most experimental one yet and I canâ€™t wait to be able to show you more!

In the meantime, hereâ€™s a lil teaser of whatâ€™s to come:
