<h2 class="post-heading">Joining Forces</h2>

We're teaming up with Cave Bear Games!

We founded Dream Matter Labs because we experienced how difficult it is to break into the game industry as a junior and wanted to forge our own path.

But while weâ€™re now creating games to bring our own dreams to life, we also want to help others like us by building a supportive community.

Cave Bear Games shares this vision and is actively creating opportunities to help the next generation of game industry talent land their first job.

As a result, weâ€™re joining their Partner Studio Programâ€”combining our strengths to share insights, pool resources, and challenge how things our done.
