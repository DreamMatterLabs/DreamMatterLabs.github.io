<h2 class="post-h2">We're Teaming Up!</h2>

<a class="post-link" href="/2025/03/21/dream-matter-labs-introduction/">Last week</a>, we talked about how we founded Dream Matter Labs because we experienced firsthand how difficult it is to enter the game industry as a junior nowadays and wanted to forge our own path. Because of that, we now dedicate ourselves to bringing dreams to life, whether that be ours or yours, literal or figurative.

This means that if you are a fellow indie developer or someone aspiring to enter the game industry like us, we want to help you achieve your dreams. Fortunately, Cave Bear Games shares part of this mission as they’re actively creating opportunities to help the next generation of game industry talent with landing their first job.

As a result, we’re joining their Partner Studio Program—combining our strengths to share insights, pool resources, and challenge how things are done. This way, as we work on our games and navigate the saturated marketplace as a fully independent studio, we aim to create a supportive community where we get to help others like us.

Here, we will try our best to provide you with valuable content, regardless of your discipline. For now, feel free to check out our Discord where we are frequently adding new resources or follow this blog where we post every Friday. This is only the beginning so stay tuned as we have some cool stuff and collaborations cooking up!
