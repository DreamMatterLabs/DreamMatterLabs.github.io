<h2 class="post-h2">Joining Forces!</h2>

<a class="post-link" href="/2025/03/21/dream-matter-labs-introduction/">Last week</a>, we talked about how we founded Dream Matter Labs because we experienced firsthand how difficult it is to enter the game industry as a junior nowadays and wanted to forge our own path. As a result, we now dedicate ourselves to bringing dreams to life.

This means that if you are a fellow indie developer or simply someone aspiring to enter the game industry like us, we want to help you achieve your dreams. Fortunately, Cave Bear Games shares part of this mission and helps us with shaking up the game industry. 

Specifically, they’re actively creating opportunities to help juniors with landing their first job. As a result, we’re joining their Partner Studio Program—combining our strengths to share insights, pool resources, and challenge how things are done. 

This way, as we work on our games and navigate the saturated marketplace as a fully independent studio, we aim to create a supportive community where we get to help others like us. Here, we will try our best to help you out, regardless of your discipline. 

For now, feel free to check out our Discord where we are frequently posting new insights and resources, or follow this blog to be fully up to date with all our developments! This is only the beginning so stay tuned as we have some cool stuff and collaborations cooking up.
