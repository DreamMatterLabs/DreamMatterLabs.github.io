<h2 class="post-h2">Hey There!</h2>

A lot has happened since <a class="post-link" href="https://dreammatterlabs.com/">ONEiRA</a> got revealed to the world so I felt that it’s about time I gave you an update on what we’ve been working on. Naturally, I'll make sure to include some (highly classified) images to properly show you what is new!

<h2 class="post-h2">Polishing and Touching Up</h2>

Mainly, now that we have a <a class="post-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3521080/ONEiRA/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=other&utm_campaign=wishlist&utm_content=blogpost_5" target="_blank">Steam page</a> up and running, the focus has been on making a trailer and ensuring that the necessary features and areas are polished. SO, as a result, a lot of areas have gotten a proper lighting pass and a brand new look 😎

In my eyes, environmental lighting is such an underestimated part of game development as it seems like a small cog in the machine but really makes a world of difference. If done right, it makes a game come to life and helps guide the player to what is important.

<h2 class="post-h2">Laying the UI Groundwork</h2>

However, you may have noticed that UI has been missing from all our images so far. BUT, trust and believe that it is being worked on. Similarly to environmental lighting, I find UI to be such a crucial part of game development so it's super-duper exciting!

Do keep in mind that this is an early draft of the UI and will be updated significantly in the upcoming weeks—Stay tuned! For now, this is a prototype of a menu that allows players to access their inventory, view their progress, and learn more about <a class="post-link" href="https://dreammatterlabs.com/">ONEiRA</a>.

<h2 class="post-h2">A Glimpse Into the Future</h2>

While I’ve mainly shown you stuff about our trippy mushroom world, a new one is right around the corner! In terms of technology, this dreamscape will definitely be our most experimental one yet and I can’t wait to be able to show you more!

In the meantime, here’s a lil teaser of what’s to come:
