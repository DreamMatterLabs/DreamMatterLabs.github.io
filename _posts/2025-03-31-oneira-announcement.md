<h2 class="post-heading">Hello World!</h2>

Dream Matter Labs is an independent video game studio focused on bringing dreams to life. 

As a team of juniors, we know how exhausting it can be to break into the game industry—and we’re tired of waiting for it to recognize our potential. So, we decided to create our own studio and forge our own path.

Here, while we gain real-world experience and show the industry exactly what we can do, our goal is to create surreal, narrative-driven games that blur the lines between dreams and reality. Follow along so we can share our adventure with you and unveil our debut game!
