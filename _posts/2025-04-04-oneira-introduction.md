<h2 class="post-heading">Introducing Our Debut Game!</h2>

**4 April, 2025**—For the past year, our team has been working tirelessly on something truly special. Namely, a narrative-driven puzzle-platformer where your choices matter called ONEiRA. Here, you get to delve into a world where dreams are sold as entertainment, and where it’s your job as the underpaid maintenance worker, to get each experience market-ready.

By entering and inspecting various virtual dreamscapes, you get to explore surreal, immersive environments that each contain a story waiting to be unraveled. Specifically, as you navigate the minds behind each dream, cryptic messages and lingering voices pull you deeper into a psychological mystery where the truth is waiting to be untangled.

Just follow the company guidelines and make sure you tread carefully as each decision you make alters the story and the dreamscape around you. Additionally, listen closely to the characters that you encounter on your journey, as some may know more than they let on. Will you choose wisely and uncover the hidden truths or will you let them slip away?

ONEiRA is still in development for a little while longer, but we’re excited to bring you along for the journey. We’ll be sharing regular updates here on the blog and across our socials, giving you a closer look at our progress. Moreover, we’d love to hear your thoughts along the way, so don’t hesitate to share your thoughts and help us shape the best possible experience!
