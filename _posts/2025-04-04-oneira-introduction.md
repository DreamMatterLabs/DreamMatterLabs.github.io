<h2 class="post-h2">Introducing Our Debut Game!</h2>

**4 April, 2025**—For the past year, our team has been working tirelessly on something truly special: <a class="post-link" href="https://dreammatterlabs.com/">ONEiRA</a>—a narrative-driven puzzle-platformer where your choices matter. Step into a world where dreams are sold as entertainment and you're the underpaid maintenance worker making sure each experience is market-ready.

By entering and inspecting various virtual dreamscapes, you get to explore surreal, immersive environments that each contain a story waiting to be unraveled. Specifically, as you navigate the minds behind each dream, cryptic messages and lingering voices pull you deeper into a psychological mystery where the truth is waiting to be untangled.

Just follow the company guidelines and tread carefully as each decision you make shapes the story and dreamscape around you. Additionally, listen closely to the characters that you encounter on your journey, as some may know more than they let on. Will you choose wisely and uncover the hidden truths or will you let them slip away?

ONEiRA is still in development for a little while longer,  but we’re excited to finally start sharing it with you. For now, you can join us on our socials where we’ll be posting regular updates—and let us know what you think! We’d love to bring you along for this adventure and shape ONEiRA together as we prepare for its Steam release.
