<h2 class="post-h2">Hey There!</h2>

It’s already been a little over a month since we introduced Dream Matter Labs to the world, so I wanted to give you all an update on what’s been happening. However, before that, I wanted to thank all of you on behalf of the entire team for supporting us!

<h2 class="post-h2">The Month of April</h2>

If I had to choose one word to describe the month of April, it would be ‘chaotic’. Not necessarily because we’re incredibly messy and incompetent, but because operating as an indie studio is awfully similar to playing Overcooked.

It’s like a bunch of little devs running around in the indie kitchen, trying to make and deliver content to people on time. Although, fortunately for us, this doesn’t take place in a hot air balloon that’s bursting with flames and rapidly falling out of the sky...

Personally, I always imagined that if you were in a team and able to distribute tasks, you would have much more time on your hands. But it turns out that with more time on your hands, more opportunities arise, and more work needs to get done.

Specifically, just this month, we:

- Created a <a class="post-link" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3521080/ONEiRA/?utm_source=website&utm_medium=other&utm_campaign=wishlist&utm_content=blogpost_5" target="_blank">Steam page</a>.
- Started posting weekly on our socials.
- Partnered up with Cave Bear Games.
- Hired 3 level designers and 1 concept artist.
- Drafted an announcement trailer.

(Massive respect gained for recruiters)

<h2 class="post-h2">Pleasing the Steam Algorithm</h2>

Here, the Steam page ended up taking most of our time. For those unfamiliar, Steam puts indie studios in an awkward position as its algorithm rewards pages that have been up for a long time and also include a trailer that properly shows off the game.

This means that we can’t afford to wait until our game is ready for us to start showcasing it. Instead, we needed to plan our trailer strategically and prioritize development on certain areas of <a class="post-link" href="https://dreammatterlabs.com/">ONEiRA</a> that we wanted to show off.

As a result, this then throws a wrench in the development process and puts a lot of pressure on getting this done quickly. Thankfully, most of this work is now behind us and I hope to be able to show you an official announcement trailer soon!

<h2 class="post-h2">What's Next?</h2>

With most of the essentials out of the way, we are focusing our efforts on getting <a class="post-link" href="https://dreammatterlabs.com/">ONEiRA</a> ready for you all to playtest. After all, our community is most important to us and we can't wait to get your direct feedback on the game as soon as possible.

In the meantime, I will spend more time on trying to get you all content that helps and delights you. Specifically, I want to kickstart our <a class="post-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/@DreamMatterLabs" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> soon so we can show you the behind-the-scenes of <a class="post-link" href="https://dreammatterlabs.com/">ONEiRA</a> and dive deep into some of its features!
